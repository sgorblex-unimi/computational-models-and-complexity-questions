\section{Modifications of \NFAs}

\subsection{\NFAs with multiple starting states}
% TODO: context. Mention that eps-transitions can not be eliminated cheaply in general (citation), so using eps-transitions is not a so immediate solution
\begin{thrm}
	Every $n$-state NFA with multiple starting states can be simulated by an $(n+1)$-state NFA with a single starting state.
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
	% TODO
	\dots
\end{proof}

\subsection{Languages with a symbol prefix/suffix and end-markers}
% TODO: adaptation of the previous subsec to transform an NFA for xL in an NFA for L; construction for the mirrored problem; conclusions on the fact that we can build an NFA for lem L rem and then converting it in one for L
