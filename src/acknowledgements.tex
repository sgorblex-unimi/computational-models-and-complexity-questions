\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
In the course of my Master's degree, I experienced a number of adventures.
I met peers of great intelligence, inspiring professors, and exceptionally talented researchers.
I lived and studied in three different countries, finding new value in what I had and discovering it in what I didn't know.
% I had some of the best and some of the worst times of my life.
I experienced some of the best and some of the most challenging moments of my life.
% But you take what you can get, and you make the most of it.
But when you're down you're down, and when you're up you're up.
And while I am slowly finding my way into this weird, wonderful world, there's still a million things I haven't done.
It is in moments like this, at the end of a journey that had such a profound impact on life, that one has to take a moment to reflect on what made it possible, and what made each day a little bit better.

I would like to thank Giovanni Pighizzini and Luca Prigioniero, whose competence as supervisors matches their excellence as researchers.
In particular, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Luca Prigioniero.
Not only did he carry out his role as co-supervisor with the utmost expertise and helpfulness, but I found in him a mentor and, ultimately, a friend.
% A heartfelt thanks goes to my parents, who never ceased to support me, and without whom none of this would be possible.
A heartfelt thanks goes to my family: my parents, whose constant support made all of this possible, and my sister Francesca, with whom I have enjoyed many memorable sibling moments, and in whom I have found an unexpected friend.
I am also deeply grateful to my peers and friends from Milan, Copenhagen, and Loughborough, who were the very heart of this journey and kept me going day after day.

Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to the professors and researchers whose passion for their work inspires and motivates others.
They are the true heart of the university.
