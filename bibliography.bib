  abstract = {We study how the number of states may change when we convert between different finite-state devices. The devices that we consider are finite automata that are one-way or two-way, deterministic or nondeterministic or alternating. We obtain several new simulation results (e.g., an n-state 2NFA can be simulated by a 1NFA with \_{$<$}8" + 2 states, and by a 1AFA with {$<$} n 2 states), and state-incompressibility results (e.g., in order to simulate an n-state 2DFA, a 1NFA needs {$>$} x/\textasciitilde "-z states, and a 2AFA needs {$>$}cx/n states for some constant c, in general).},
